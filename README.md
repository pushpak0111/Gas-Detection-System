**🔥 Gas Leakage Detection System using Raspberry Pi**

A real-time gas detection and alert system built using Raspberry Pi and the MQ-2 gas sensor. The system continuously monitors the environment for hazardous gas levels (e.g., LPG, methane, smoke) and sends immediate alerts to the user while triggering safety actions like buzzers and LEDs.

**🚀 Features**

▹ Real-time gas leakage detection

▹ Sends smartphone alerts via messaging/email service

▹ Live data visualization using ThingSpeak dashboard

▹ Activates buzzer and LED indicators for instant feedback

▹ Supports monitoring for multiple houses/zones

**🧰 Tech Stack**

▹ Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4/5, MQ-2 Gas Sensor, Buzzer, LEDs, Jumper Wires

▹ Software: Python (GPIO), Thonny

▹ Communication: Wi-Fi-based notification system

▹ OS: Raspberry Pi OS (Linux-based)


**📦 Components Used**

▹ Raspberry Pi 4 / 5

▹ MQ-2 Gas Sensor

▹ Buzzer

▹ LED (Red, Green)

▹ MicroSD Card (32GB recommended)

▹ Male-to-Female Jumper Wires

▹ Power Adapter

**🖥️ Working**

MQ-2 sensor detects combustible gas levels.

If gas concentration exceeds the threshold:

Buzzer and red LED are triggered.

A notification is sent to the user’s phone.

Green LED indicates normal conditions.
