🔥 Gas Leakage Detection System using Raspberry Pi
A real-time gas detection and alert system built using Raspberry Pi and the MQ-2 gas sensor. The system continuously monitors the environment for hazardous gas levels (e.g., LPG, methane, smoke) and sends immediate alerts to the user while triggering safety actions like buzzers and LEDs.

🚀 Features
Real-time gas leakage detection

Sends smartphone alerts via messaging/email service

Live data visualization using ThingSpeak dashboard

Activates buzzer and LED indicators for instant feedback

Supports monitoring for multiple houses/zones
